## Project Overview

- This project aims to analyze client behavior and key performance metrics for Vanguard's online investment process. The goal is to determine if the new user interface (UI) leads to a higher completion rate compared to the traditional UI through A/B testing.

## Hypotheses

### 1st Hypothesis: Completion Rate Analysis

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant difference in completion rates between the Test and Control groups.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The completion rate is significantly higher in the Test group compared to the Control group.

### 2nd Hypothesis: Completion Rate with Cost-Effectiveness Threshold

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The increase in completion rate is less than 5%.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The increase in completion rate is at least 5%.

### 3rd Hypothesis: Interaction Patterns

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no difference in the number of actions taken between the Test and Control groups.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant difference in the number of actions taken between the Test and Control groups.

## Data Sources
1. `df_final_demo.csv`: Client demographic data.
2. `df_final_web_data_pt_1.csv`: Web interaction data for the first period.
3. `df_final_web_data_pt_2.csv`: Web interaction data for the second period.
4. `df_final_experiment_clients.csv`: Information on clients involved in the experiment.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
1. **Loading Data:** Load and inspect datasets.
2. **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:** Perform initial analysis to understand variables relation, and outlier detection.
3. **Cleaning Data:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address outliers.
4. **Merging Datasets:** Merge datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Demographic Analysis:** Analyze client demographics (age, gender, tenure, balance).
2. **Behavior Analysis:** Study client behavior based on web interaction data.
3. **High-Value Clients:** Identified primary clients based on the A/B testing, and before cleaning identified high value clients (with outliers).

## Design Effectiveness and Power Analysis
1. **Duration Acessment:** As showed on the line graph, 4 months were indeed enough to reach normalization.
2. **Power Analysis on Completion Rate:** The required sample size per group was 3926, well inferior to our sample sizes, which means it was enough for the experiment.

- **Overall the A/B testing was well structured with an homogenous traits (gender, balance, age) on both samples, with enough sizes and time to obtain tangible results!**

## Conclusion

- The new user interface significantly improved the completion rate. The A/B test design was effective, and the sample size was sufficient to detect meaningful differences.
